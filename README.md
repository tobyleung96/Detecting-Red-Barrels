# Detecting Red Barrels


## Introduction: 
This assignment required us to train a model that detects red barrels in images. Furthermore, the output had to display the real-world distance of each red barrel from the camera. Building a model with 30 images, each with a respective real-world distance, the outcome had to be generalizable to unseen images of red barrels.
